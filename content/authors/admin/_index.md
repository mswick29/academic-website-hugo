Welcome to my personal site! I am a second-year PhD student studying under Drs. Kristin Hansen Lagattuta ([Mind-Emotion Development Lab](https://mindemotiondevelopmentlab.ucdavis.edu/)) & Emilio Ferrer ([Dynamics in Psychological Science Lab](https://dynamics.ucdavis.edu/)) at the University of California, Davis. As my academic career takes shape, so should this site! 

Feel free to peruse my posts, review my experience, and reach out with any questions.
